police officer escorts Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon after he served a sentence for document forgery in Podgorica, Montenegro, March 23, 2024.\n\nStevo Vasiljevic | Reuters\n\nDo Kwon, the South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur behind two digital currencies that lost an estimated $40 billion in 2022,pleaded not guilty on Thursday to U.S.criminal fraud charges, after being extradited from Montenegro this week.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Kwon, who co-founded Singapore-based Terraform Labs and developed the [TerraUSD](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LUNA.CM=/) and Luna currencies, in March 2023 with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and conspiracy.\n\nAn updated 79-page indictment filed on Thursday added a count of money laundering conspiracy.\n\nKwon,33,entered his plea before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger in Manhattan federal court.\n\nHe had agreed last June to pay an $80 million civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion settlement that he and Terraform reached with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s indictment, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s office alleged Kwon misled investors in 2021 about TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1.\n\nKwon allegedly told investors a computer algorithm known as \u201cTerra Protocol\u201d had restored the coin\u2019s value when it slipped below its peg in May 2021, when in fact he arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the token to artificially prop up its price.\n\nProsecutors said that false claim and others drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna, a more traditional token developed by Kwon that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD, to $50 billion by the spring of 2022.\n\n\u201cMuch of this growth followed Kwon\u2019s brazen deceptions about Terraform and its technology,\u201d the indictment said.\n\nWhen TerraUSD\u2019s value began sliding again in May 2022, the trading firm warned that propping it up \u201cwasn\u2019t so simple this time,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nTerraUSD and Luna crashed that month, dragging down the value of other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, and caused wider havoc in the crypto market.\n\nProsecutors did not identify the trading firm, but it matches the description of Jump Trading, which SEC lawyers said in their civil case had propped up TerraUSD in May 2021.Jump did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a trial on the SEC\u2019s claims, a federal jury in Manhattan found Kwon and Terraform liable last April for defrauding cryptocurrency investors.\n\nA lawyer for Terraform said in closing arguments in that trial that Terraform and Kwon had been truthful about their products and how they worked, even when they failed.\n\nKwon did not attend that trial because he had been detained in Montenegro since March 2023. Terraform declared bankruptcy last January.\n\nKwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.\n\nTrending Now\n\n1.

He was in Singapore before his business crashed and fled to Serbia before being picked up in Montenegro.\n\nKwon was arrested in March 2023 as he tried to board a flight to Dubai at Podgorica Airport, in Montenegro's capital.\n\nIn June 2023, he was sentenced to four months of jail in Montenegro having been found guilty of forging official documents.\n\nThe former finance officer of Terraform Labs, Hon Chang-joon, was extradited to South Korea in February, after serving four months in prison in Montenegro over fraud charges.\n\n[South Korea 'cryptocrash king' Do Kwon jailed ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65957999)\n\n[Fugitive 'cryptocrash' boss arrested in Montenegro --------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65058533)\n\n[US watchdog charges 'cryptocrash' boss with fraud -------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64671745)\n\n[South Korea](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cnx753jej1xt)\n\n[Montenegro](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cvenzmgylmwt)\n\n[United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cx1m7zg01xyt)\n\n[Cryptocurrency](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cyd7z4rvdm3t)\n\n* * *\n\nRelated\n\n[South Korea banned dog meat.
